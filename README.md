# DiV-Coding-Challenge-1.0

This is a Coding Challenge. Here is the question:
 Create two simple pages, first page would be to sign up and login users using the LinkedIn API, the second page is where users will land after they sign up or login.

As a current Intermediate Front-End Developer, I have been able to create a sign up and login page, as well as a landing page after users login or signup. However, I have not been able to integrate the LinkedIn API to the signup and login page. 

I could have integrated the LinkedIn API to the signup and login page by watching tutorials. Truth is, though I can get the job done,  I don't want to be the kind of developer who gets the job done without actually understanding what is going on. Therefore,I would prefer to learn the whole concept of API to understand things better.

So, my project is not complete but I am intentionally submitting it this way because I don't have such skills yet. But I would get there soon.
